# Pentago

This game was developed for an Artificial Intelligence course, alongside [Pedro Silva](https://github.com/arcanjo45) and [Filipa Barroso].(https://github.com/FilipaBarroso)

The user can choose between three game types:
 * Human vs Human
 * Human vs Computer
 * Computer vs Computer

If the computer is selected, the user can decide how the bot behaves:
 * Random valid play
 * Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning

Rules ([source](https://perfect-pentago.net/details.html)):

> Pentago is played on a 6 by 6 board, divided into four 3 by 3 quadrants. There are two players, black and white, who alternate turns. The goal of each player is to get five stones of their color in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each turn, a player places a stone in an empty space in some quadrant, then chooses a possibly different quadrant to rotate 90 degrees left or right. If both players get five in a row at the same time, or the last move is played with no five in a row, the game is a tie. If a player makes five a row by placing a stone, there is no need to rotate a quadrant: the player wins immediately.
